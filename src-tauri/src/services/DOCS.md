# Services

Business logic layer. Services own state and behavior; Tauri commands delegate to them.

## Layout

One file or directory per service; the file name is the service name. Directories where a file's place does not follow from its name:

- `ai/` — `provider.rs` (`AiProvider`, `CompletionRequest`, `StreamChunk`), `openai.rs` (Completions) and `openai_responses.rs` (Responses), `http.rs` (`OpenAiHttp`, the HTTP layer both OpenAI providers share), `encoder.rs` (per-API capability encoding functions), `sse.rs` (SSE line parser)
- `execution/` — `lifecycle.rs` (`PromptExecutionService`, `ExecutionError`), `skill_executor.rs` and `conversation_executor.rs` (message preparation and result recording), `stream.rs` (stream and tool loop)
- `change_log/` — see [change_log/DOCS.md](change_log/DOCS.md)
- `settings_agent/` — see [settings_agent/DOCS.md](settings_agent/DOCS.md)
- `secrets.rs` — see "Secrets" below
- `settings_sync/` — `git.rs` (`GitRunner`), `detect.rs`, `reload.rs`
- `speech/` — see [speech/DOCS.md](speech/DOCS.md); `mcp/` — see [mcp/DOCS.md](mcp/DOCS.md)

## Conventions

### Error handling

Each service defines its own error enum using `thiserror::Error`. Variants use `#[from]` for automatic conversion from upstream errors (`std::io::Error`, `serde_json::Error`).

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ConfigError {
    #[error("IO error: {0}")]
    Io(#[from] std::io::Error),
    // ...
}
```

### Service lifecycle

Services are plain structs (not singletons). They are created once at startup in `setup/state.rs` and placed into Tauri managed state. Services whose methods take `&mut self`, or that are replaced whole (`AiService` on settings reload), are behind `Arc<Mutex<…>>`; the others are managed without an outer `Mutex` (for example `ClipboardService`, `McpRegistry`, `RecordingWidget`, `SettingsSync`): they expose only `&self` methods and lock internally where they hold mutable state. Check `setup/state.rs` for the exact managed type before calling `state::<T>()`. The command layer is responsible for locking and calling service methods.

- **Constructor**: no single rule; `ConfigService`, `SkillService` and `UiStateService` use `Service::load(args)`, most others `new`, `Database` uses `open` and `McpRegistry` uses `start_all`.
- **Persistence**: no service exposes a public `save`. `ConfigService` writes inside `mutate`; `UiStateService` mutators write their file themselves.
- **Reload**: `ConfigService::reload` re-reads `settings.json`, replacing in-memory state.

### Window lookup

Tauri's `get_webview_window(label)` returns `None` when the window holds any webview whose label differs from the window label (`Window::is_webview_window`). `conversation-dialog` (toolbar and content children added with `add_child`) is such a window: look it up with `get_window` (window APIs) and `get_webview` (`eval`, navigation). `dialog::open_or_focus` returns `(tauri::Window, created)` for this reason. To bring the chat window up from any entry path call `ai_webview::surface` (create or show the host, pick the view, `focus_host_window`); do not call `open_or_focus` or `focus_host_window` for `conversation-dialog` directly. `focus_host_window` brings an already mapped window up through `dialog::activate_window`: on GNOME Wayland it calls the extension's `ActivateWindow` with the window title read at call time (Mutter denies `set_focus()` there), skips the call when the window is focused and falls back to `set_focus()` on a D-Bus error; elsewhere it calls `set_focus()`. The helper's callers are `focus_host_window` (so `surface_inner` and `activate_tab`), the `open_or_focus` reuse path and the text-preview reuse path; it never logs the title. For a window with one webview use `dialog::window(app, label)` (error `<label> window not found`); `monitor::cursor_work_area(win)` gives the cursor and its monitor's work area in logical px.

### Chat window corners (GNOME Wayland)

Only on GNOME Wayland `open_or_focus` builds `conversation-dialog` transparent (`.transparent(true)`, alpha-0 window background) and calls `chat_corners::install`; the toolbar, native chat and provider children get alpha-0 backgrounds there too (`SHELL_BG` everywhere else, and on macOS the opaque `SHELL_BG` window). The GTK box draws only the shadow, outside the webviews (below): the parent cairo clip on `default_vbox()` is not honoured by WebKitGTK children (live run 2026-11-11), so every page cuts its own corners and draws its own border. The toolbar page rounds the top corners and draws the 1 px `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` border on top, left and right (`.titlebar.rounded`, `html.rounded` transparent). The native chat page (`conversation-dialog/App.svelte`, `html.rounded`) makes `html` and `body` transparent (a `body` background would move to the canvas, which ignores `border-radius`; `.dialog-shell` keeps painting), clips `body` with `clip-path: inset(0 round 0 0 10px 10px)` (fixed descendants included) and draws the left, right and bottom border with `body::after`. Provider pages get `provider_corners_script(rounded)`: one `<style id="__promptheus-corners">` on `<html>` with the same clip-path and an `html::after` border overlay, or its removal when square. It is an initialization script of `create_provider_child` (value fixed at creation, runs before `<head>` exists), re-evaluated on every `PageLoadEvent::Finished` and, by `chat_corners::apply`, in every provider webview of the host on a state change. State rule `rounded_for_state`: square when the GDK `WindowState` has `MAXIMIZED`, `FULLSCREEN`, `TILED` or a `*_TILED` flag, rounded otherwise (the `*_RESIZABLE` flags do not count). On the main thread `install` connects `connect_window_state_event` on the toplevel (`Window::gtk_window()`; another thread would connect GTK closures on the wrong thread); on each change `apply` stores the state and emits `shell:corners` `{ rounded }` to `shell-toolbar` and the native chat webview, which also read the current value with `get_chat_corners` on mount. The state is one process-wide flag (one chat host window). The palette window and its backdrop (separate transparent top-level windows placed over the chat content area) round their bottom corners and draw the left, right and bottom border from the same flag: the palette page by a `clip-path: inset(0 round 0 0 10px 10px)` on a full-viewport `body` (clips the fixed scrim and modal), the backdrop page by `html[data-corners="rounded"]` set by `eval` when the palette opens, with `html` background `linear-gradient(transparent, transparent)` so the `body` dim is not propagated to the canvas.

**Shadow** (rounded state only; mechanism, traps and the cut of the blur in [`docs/gotchas/linux-chat-window-corners.md`](../../../docs/gotchas/linux-chat-window-corners.md)). `install` also adds a `CssProvider` to `default_vbox()`, connects a `configure-event` handler (input region) and `dialog::attach_shadow_resize_handler` on the toplevel; `apply_shadow` runs next to `apply` on each state change. Rounded: style class `chat-window-shadow` (`box-shadow: 0 10px 14px rgba(0,0,0,.55), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,.35)`, GTK's 14 px blur matching the mockup's browser 28 px), box margins and `gdk::Window::set_shadow_width` of 28 left and right, 18 top, 38 bottom, input region of the visible rect grown by 10 px. Square: none of them. GDK then reports the visible rect as the xdg window geometry, so Mutter's frame rect (maximize, tiling, `PlaceWindowOnParent`) is the visible window, while tao's `inner_size` is the whole surface: `save_geometry` and the palette/backdrop size subtract `chat_corners::shadow_width()`. A `gtk_window_set_decorated` call on the host resets the shadow width to 0. `dialog::edge_at` resizes from 10 px outside to 5 px × scale inside the visible edge, reading the margins from the box.

**Routes.** Taken: page-level corners (above), over a transparent host. Rejected:
- Route (a), a GTK client-side frame: needs a decorated window, which disables `attach_undecorated_resize_handler`, adds the Adwaita shadow, shifts the content below y=0 and still does not clip the bottom corners.
- Route (b), a cairo clip on the `GtkBox` holding the child webviews (`default_vbox()`), set before the children draw, with the border stroked after them: failed live on 2026-11-11. WebKitGTK children do not honour the parent's clip, so the bottom corners stayed square (the top corners were round only because of the toolbar page's CSS); the stroke drawn after the children lies beneath them, so the box draws nothing now. GDK3 on Wayland applies no visual window shape, only an input region, so a corner is cut only by alpha.
- CSS injected into provider pages was rejected at first to leave them untouched; it is taken since the failed live run, as the single `provider_corners_script` rule.

**Live results** (GNOME Wayland; first run 2026-11-11 at `7b3bcef`, second run 2026-11-11 at `9e41e4c`):
- Corner pixels show the window underneath: top corners round at `7b3bcef`, bottom corners square (route (b) failed); at `9e41e4c` native chat shows four rounded corners.
- No seam at the toolbar/content boundary near the corners: not checked live yet.
- No white or square flash on resize, tab switch, palette open/close: not checked live yet.
- Border unbroken over native chat: OK at `9e41e4c` (2026-11-11); over a Claude tab: OK at `9e41e4c` (2026-11-11); over a ChatGPT tab: not confirmed.
- Not checked live yet: palette open and closed, maximize, fullscreen and tiling (square, no border), resize from every edge and corner, move to a monitor with another scale, NVIDIA.
- Shadow (variant E, added after the second run): not checked live yet. To check: shadow visible over Settings and the desktop, not cut at the surface border; none maximized, fullscreen or tiled (also double-click maximize); a click on the shadow reaches the window below, also after closing and reopening the chat window; resize from each edge and corner at the visible edge; maximize and tile without gaps, restore keeps the size; restart keeps the visible size; palette, backdrop and provider menu aligned; scale change redraws.

### Settings sync

`settings_sync` runs the system `git` CLI with the login-shell environment (`shell_env`), never interactively: stdin null, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `ssh -o BatchMode=yes` unless the user configured ssh, per-command timeout with `kill_on_drop`. `detect()` finds the repo from the `settings.json`, `prompts`, `skills` symlinks of the config dir (none → `off`, different repos → `error`). A cycle: detect, `fetch`, `lock_local()` hook (which also runs `reload::reload_if_changed`: an external change of `settings.json`, such as a manual `git pull`/`reset` or a hand edit, is reloaded at the start of every cycle), `add -A` + `commit` on the target paths only (`*.tmp` excluded), `rebase --autostash @{u}`, `reload` hook for files changed by the rebase, unlock, `push` when ahead. A failed rebase is aborted and the engine pauses (`conflict`): `Periodic` triggers take `lock_local` (so an external change is still reloaded) and return without running git until a `Startup`/`Manual` cycle succeeds; the pause is in memory only. Locks, reload, events and toasts are supplied by the caller through `SyncHooks`. Logs and errors carry git stderr only, never file contents or diffs. The app hooks (`AppHooks` in `services/settings_sync/mod.rs`; `run_sync` is the cycle entry point, the commands `get_settings_sync_status` and `sync_settings_now` wrap it) lock `ConfigService` then `SkillService` (owned guards held across the local git steps), and lock history after them, in `lock_local` (for `reload_if_changed`) and in `reload`: lock order is config → skills → history; nothing may take config while holding skills. `reload::reload_changed` decides what to reload from the changed paths, compared canonically: the `settings.json` target → `ConfigService::reload` and a skills reload (`skills_order` lives in settings); a path under the `skills` target → skills reload and `prune_missing_skills`; `prompts` only → nothing (prompts are read from disk on use); a path under the change-log directory → `Reloaded.change_log` and a `change-log-changed` event (see [change_log/DOCS.md](change_log/DOCS.md)). Flags from `lock_local` and `reload` are OR-ed (`Reloaded::merge`). After the guards drop, shortcuts, autostart and the dock icon are re-applied and `settings-changed` / `skills-changed` (reason `sync`) are emitted; `AiService` is rebuilt by `apply_settings_reload`. `mcp_servers` and `show_tray_icon` changes apply only after restart. Cycles run on start, every 5 minutes (`setup/background.rs`) and on `sync_settings_now`; status goes out as `settings-sync-status-changed`, and an Error toast shows only when a cycle enters `conflict` or `error`.

### ClipboardService specifics

Reads text and images with the `arboard` crate; writes text through `write_text` (below). The struct holds `app: Option<AppHandle>` (`None` only in tests, via `without_app`): with an app, `set_text` goes through `write_text`; without, through `arboard`.

**Key pattern — no stored clipboard handle**: `arboard::Clipboard` is not `Send`/`Sync`, so it cannot be held across await points or stored in shared state. Each read creates a fresh `arboard::Clipboard` per call.

**Error variants**:
- `Unavailable` — clipboard is empty or content can't be read (soft error)
- `Access` — clipboard system is inaccessible (hard error)
- `ImageConversion` — image encode/decode failed

**Image pipeline**: `arboard::ImageData` (raw RGBA pixels) → `image::ImageBuffer` → PNG encode → base64 string. Returns `(base64_data, media_type)` tuple.

**Reads**: `get_text` trims and fails with `Unavailable` on empty; `get_text_raw` returns the text untouched (the raw-paste path); `has_image`, `has_file_list` and `get_image_base64` serve the paste-kind logic. `paste_kind(has_file_list, has_image)` decides what a paste into the context does: file list → nothing (files are not pasteable items, even when an image or text is also offered), else image, else text. `read_clipboard_item(&ClipboardService)` applies it off the async runtime (`spawn_blocking`) and returns `Option<PastedItem>` (`None` for a file list); every clipboard → context path uses it: the `set_context_value` and `append_context_value` hotkeys, `set_context_from_clipboard`, `append_context_from_clipboard` and the pill Paste, all through `write_clipboard_to_context` in `commands/context.rs`. On `None` the context stays unchanged, no `context-changed` is emitted and no toast shows. `get_clipboard_text` (command) is `ClipboardService::get_text`.

**Clipboard fingerprint**: `ClipboardService::fingerprint()` (blocking, call from `spawn_blocking`) returns a `ClipboardFingerprint`: non-empty text → `Text(hash)`; else raw image (`get_image` bytes plus size, never PNG-encoded) → `Image(hash)`; else non-empty file list → `Files(hash)`; else `Empty`. `ContentNotAvailable` or an empty value means "absent, try the next format"; any other arboard error (or no clipboard handle) → `Unreadable`, reading stops. Used by stop + chat: `store_pending_copy` keeps the snapshot with a uuid token; the command `copy_chat_answer_if_unchanged(token, text)` (`commands/clipboard.rs`) takes the slot, compares a fresh fingerprint and writes `text` only if the token is the current one and the fingerprints are equal and not `Unreadable`.

**Linux text writes**: `write_text` pipes the text to `wl-copy` when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set; without it, or when the tool is missing (`warn` log `clipboard subprocess failed`), it falls back to `tauri_plugin_clipboard_manager`; on GNOME Wayland that fallback writes the XWayland clipboard and the text does not reach Wayland apps, without an error. The `.deb` therefore depends on `wl-clipboard` (`bundle.linux.deb.depends` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`).

### ConfigService specifics

**Load sequence** (`ConfigService::load`): `load_env` (`<config dir>/.env`, then `dotenvy::dotenv_override()` from the working directory and its parents, both overriding the process environment; sets `CONFIG_DIR`) → default `settings.json` (embedded with `include_str!`), `.env` and prompt files written when `settings.json` is missing → read and `build_settings` (also used by `reload`): `parse_and_migrate` (schema migration in `migrator.rs`) → legacy prompt file moves and defaults → `migrate_model_params` → capability sanitizing → `ensure_surface_defaults` (sets the chat model to the first text model when it is empty or unknown; leaves empty quick actions and title generation ids empty, resolved to the chat model at run time, see "Model resolution") → `validate` → `write`. A model's `api_key` is a literal key or a `${VAR}` reference, resolved at use by `ModelConfig::resolved_api_key`; `write` serializes the settings as they are, with no key stripping.

**Settings writers**: `update_setting(key, value)` returns `Result`; the accepted keys are the arms of the `match` on `key` in `ConfigService::update_setting` (`config/mod.rs`). `env_vars` replaces the whole list (checked by `validate`); its writer is `settings_agent/plan.rs::set_env_vars` for the four env var operations (`add_env_var`, `update_env_var`, `rename_env_var`, `delete_env_var`, reached by the agent and by the command `apply_env_var_operation`), while the agent operation `set_setting` refuses `env_vars` and no frontend code sends it to the `update_setting` command. A wrong JSON type or an unknown key is `InvalidSettings` with that key, nothing is written. `add_shortcut_for_os(os, action, shortcut)` and `remove_shortcut_for_os(os, action, shortcut)` (`add_shortcut` / `remove_shortcut` use the current OS) act on every `os == <os>` keymap group and leave the action's other shortcuts bound; `action` must be one of the six hotkey actions (`keymaps.<action>` otherwise). `add_shortcut` checks the shortcut with `translate_shortcut`, rejects one already bound to another action in any group of that OS (ASCII case ignored) with `"<shortcut> is already used by <action>"`, does nothing when the action already has it (so `Ctrl+F2` and `ctrl+f2` never become two keys) and otherwise inserts it into the first group (created when missing). `remove_shortcut` removes the binding from every group (ASCII case ignored) and fails with `"<shortcut> is not bound to <action>"` when none matched. The commands `update_setting`, `add_shortcut` and `remove_shortcut` use `try_mutate` and then, after the config guard is dropped, re-apply at once per `reapply_for`: `launch_at_startup` → `autostart::reconcile`, a shortcut write → `reload_shortcuts`.

**Settings catalog** (`config/catalog.rs`): `ENTRIES` holds label, description, kind and `applies` (`live` | `after_restart`) per user-facing key path, served by `get_settings_catalog`; `FILE_ONLY` (test-only) the paths edited only in the file. A test walks a serialized `Settings` and fails on a leaf in neither.

**Mutations go through `ConfigService::mutate`**: it reloads `settings.json` when its bytes differ from the last read or written, runs the closure, validates the result (`validate` plus `catalog::check_changed`, which checks only leaves that differ from before the closure against the catalog `kind` constraints), then writes. A rejection restores the settings from before the closure and writes nothing; the error is `ConfigError::InvalidSettings { key, message }` and its `Display` ends in ` (setting: <concrete key>)` when one field is at fault (`models[<id>].model`). `try_mutate` is the fallible form: a closure returning `Err` is rejected the same way. Files a closure wrote before failing are not rolled back. No public `save` exists. A reload inside `mutate` is applied to runtime state by `commands::settings::apply_settings_reload`, called after the config guard is dropped. A failed reload fails the mutation and writes nothing. `settings.json` is written in place with `std::fs::write` because it may be a symlink into the settings repo; a temp-file rename would replace the symlink and stop sync.

**Mutators**: `update_*` and `add_model`/`update_model` (upsert)/`delete_model` change the in-memory settings only; they run inside `mutate`. STT models live in the same `models` list (discriminated by `ModelConfig.model_type = Stt`). The selected STT model is `surfaces.speech_to_text.model_id`; resolve it with `ConfigService::resolve_stt_model()`. Prompts are not settings entries: they are files (below).

**Prompt files**: All prompts live as `.md` files under `<config_dir>/prompts/{base,surfaces}/`. JSON config holds only paths. Six `PromptKind`s — `System`, `AboutYou`, `Environment`, `InputFormat`, `TitleGeneration`, `SpeechToText`. Read via `config.read_prompt(kind)` / write via `config.write_prompt(kind, content)`. `PromptStore` enforces path safety: relative-only, no `..`, must end with `.md`/`.markdown`, env-var refs resolved (`config/path.rs`) before those checks. Migrator extracts inline-string prompts from legacy `settings.json` into files on first load and renames legacy field names (`system_prompt` → `system`, `environment_section` → `environment`, `about_me` → `about_you`). The `prompts/base/about_me.md` file is renamed to `about_you.md` on disk; the historical `system.md` default `"You are a helpful assistant."` is replaced with the new anti-sycophancy default (user-edited content is not touched). Only `Environment` substitutes `{{date}}`/`{{time}}`/`{{timezone}}`/`{{os}}`/`{{active_app}}`/`{{recent_apps}}` placeholders (`placeholder_registry.rs`) — other prompts are sent verbatim.

**System prompt assembly**: `build_system_prompt_base` composes the runtime system message as XML-tagged sections joined with `\n\n` (no `---` separators). Order: raw system prompt → `<user_context>` (contains `Name: {preferred_name}` + about_you body) → `<environment>` → `<input_format>`. Empty/whitespace-only sections are dropped entirely; the `Name:` line is dropped if `preferred_name` is empty. `preferred_name` is a top-level `Settings` field (default empty, trimmed and clamped to 60 chars on `update_setting`).

### Window geometry and UI state

`ui_state.rs` (`ui_state.json`, local) and the geometry persistence in `dialog.rs` stay our own code (about 90 lines). Why not `tauri-plugin-window-state` / `tauri-plugin-store` (CLAUDE.md "Rules" exception), the same three reasons cover both:

- `tauri-plugin-window-state` (2.5.0) writes its file only on `RunEvent::Exit`, so a crash or kill loses every move and resize; geometry is saved on window close here.
- Its `VISIBLE` flag restores visibility and would show the hidden chat window at startup.
- The recording pill stores user drags only, not every programmatic placement; the plugin tracks all moves.

Accepted cost: the own lines and no monitor-bounds check on restore (a window saved on a since-disconnected monitor is restored off-screen).

### Testing pattern

Service tests use `tempfile::TempDir` to create isolated config directories. A `setup_test_dir()` helper copies the example settings into a temp dir. Tests that touch env vars should set and remove them within the test.

### ContextManagerService specifics

Manages an ordered list of `ContextItem` values (text and/or images) in memory. Session-only — no persistence to disk.

**No internal locking**: the struct is a plain `Vec<ContextItem>`. Thread safety is provided by the `Arc<Mutex<ContextManagerService>>` wrapper at the state-management layer (see `setup/state.rs`).

**No error enum**: all operations are infallible in-memory list manipulation.

**Constructor**: `ContextManagerService::new()` — returns an empty service.

**Labelled context**: `labelled_context()` returns `None` without text items, otherwise one `<pasted-text name="Text #{number}">\n{content}\n</pasted-text>` block per text item (empty content included, images skipped) joined with `\n\n`; `pasted_text_block` builds a block and is shared with chat message attachments. Consumers: skill prompts (`prepare_skill_messages` wraps it as `{system_prompt}\n\n<context>\n{blocks}\n</context>` in the system message and labels context images `[Context Image #{number}]` in the user message) and command `get_labelled_context`. `get_context()` stays the raw `\n` join without tags and serves "Copy context text" (`get_context_text`) and `{{context}}`.

**Numbers**: each item gets a per-kind `number` (`Text #n`, `Image #n`) from two counters (`next_text_number`, `next_image_number`): assigned on add, kept on `remove_item`, reset to 1 by `clear` and by every replace (`set_item`, so also `set_context_from_clipboard` and the `set_context_value` hotkey; `append_item` is the add counterpart). Pill, context menu and context editor label items from it. Context hotkeys emit `context-changed` through `emit_context_changed` (version bump, pill refresh).

**`has_context` semantics**: `has_context()` is `!items.is_empty()`, so it is true for an image-only context; `get_context()` concatenates the non-empty text items with `\n` and returns `None` when there are none, so an image-only context returns `None` from it. Use `has_images()` / `get_context()` when the kind matters.

**Context version and pill**: `commands/context.rs` owns a static `CONTEXT_VERSION`; `current_context_version()` reads it and `emit_context_changed` is the only place that bumps it. After emitting `context-changed` it spawns `RecordingWidget::refresh_model`, which resizes and re-pushes the pill model when the pill is shown. Pill item removal and Paste go through `remove_item_for_pill` / `paste_item_for_pill` there; a removal whose version differs from the current one removes nothing.

### SqliteHistoryService specifics

Persistent history storage via SQLite. Database file at `{app_data_dir}/history.db`. Survives app restarts.

**Schema**: two tables — `conversations` (metadata columns + `tree_json` blob for full conversation tree) and `conversation_images` (binary image data with foreign key to conversations, cascade delete). Schema migrations via `database.rs` with version table.

**No internal locking**: plain struct with `Database`. Thread safety provided by `Arc<Mutex<SqliteHistoryService>>` at the state-management layer.

**Constructor**: `SqliteHistoryService::new(database, retention_days)` — takes ownership of a `Database` instance. `retention_days` comes from `Settings::history_retention_days`.

**ID generation**: UUID v4 via `uuid::Uuid::new_v4()`.

**Timestamp format**: `chrono::Local::now().format(DB_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT)`; the constant lives in `database.rs` and every writer and parser of stored timestamps (history, skills, clip store, search) uses it.

**Retention**: time-based, not count-based — there is no cap on the number of entries. `enforce_retention()` deletes rows whose `COALESCE(updated_at, created_at)` is older than `datetime('now', 'localtime', '-N days')`; `retention_days == 0` disables it entirely (the default). `'localtime'` is mandatory because timestamps are written as `chrono::Local`; comparing against UTC `now` would prune fresh entries at positive offsets. The sweep is **not** on the insert path — it runs once at startup (`setup/state.rs`) and again from the `update_history_retention` command when the user changes the setting. Deletes cascade to `conversation_images` and are mirrored into `conversations_fts` by the `conversations_fts_ad` trigger.

**Sorting**: `get_history()` returns entries ordered by `COALESCE(updated_at, created_at) DESC, rowid DESC`.

**Simple entries**: `add_entry()` inserts a single prompt execution (no tree_json).

**Conversation entries**: `add_conversation_entry()` serializes nodes/tree as JSON into `tree_json`, inserts images as BLOBs in a single transaction. Returns the entry ID. `update_conversation_entry()` replaces tree_json and re-inserts all images in a transaction.

**Source columns**: `conversations` has `invocation_source` (`context_menu` = skill click, `alternative_execute` = Shift+click or the action menu's "Run in dialog" (with `output_route` `chat`) or "Run with transcription" (voice run, `clipboard`); the pair tells them apart, `chat` = other conversation-dialog rows, `pill` = skill run started from the recording pill) and `output_route` (`clipboard` = skill executor rows, `chat` = conversation-dialog rows, `clipboard_chat` = pill skill run with stop + chat, written only before the chat opened at once on stop + chat; stored rows keep it). `add_conversation_entry()` writes both (the executor passes `clipboard`, the command passes `chat`); `add_entry()` writes only `output_route`, as an `Option<&str>`: successful speech entries carry `clipboard` (dictation), `chat`, `claude_desktop` or `webview:<provider id>` (from the Stop + chat setting and pill-target change on; failed and cancelled speech rows and older speech rows stay `NULL`), and `invocation_source` stays `NULL` in speech rows. `update_conversation_entry()` leaves them unchanged. Both are `NULL` in rows from before schema v7. Plain `TEXT` without `CHECK`, so new values need no schema migration. `run_skill_stream(app, …)` reads its managed states from `app`, takes `output_route` and `notify_success` (`false` skips the success toast and also shows the prepare-error toast, for the pill) and returns the created history entry id (`None` for a cancelled run); `execute_skill` passes `clipboard` and `true`. No reader yet (statistics via SQL).

**Image handling**: images received as base64 `ImagePayload`, decoded to BLOBs on save. On `get_entry_by_id()`, BLOBs are re-encoded to base64 and grouped into `node_images` (by node_id, no number) and `context_images` (node_id = NULL) on `ConversationHistoryData`. Context rows are saved with `image_index = number - 1` and read back with `ImageData.number = image_index + 1`. `build_messages_from_tree` labels context images `[Context Image #{number}]`; an image without a number gets `max(numbers) + k` for the k-th unnumbered one.

**Summary builders**: `build_input_summary` and `build_output_summary` derive summaries from nodes (last user/assistant content, truncated to 200 chars, with "+N more" suffix for multi-turn).

**Previews are not content**: for conversation entries the `input_content` / `output_content` columns hold only those summaries, and they surface on `HistoryEntry` as `input_preview` / `output_preview` to keep that visible at every call site. The full text lives in `tree_json` and is reachable through `resolve_full_content(entry_id, part)` (one row read, no image decoding) or through `conversation_data` on `get_entry_by_id`. Anything that copies, exports or re-executes text must go through `resolve_full_content`; the previews are for rendering only. Simple entries (`add_entry`, i.e. speech) store the whole value in those columns, which is why `resolve_full_content` falls back to them when there is no tree. Search (`history_search.rs`) matches previews, so a response is only searchable in its first 200 characters.

**Compaction**: `DELETE` never shrinks the SQLite file — freed pages land on the freelist and the database is in WAL mode, so a bulk delete also inflates `history.db-wal`. `compact_after_bulk_delete()` runs after any bulk delete (retention change): first `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` (cheap, no exclusive lock), then `VACUUM` only if `reclaimable > 100 MB` **and** `freelist_count / page_count > 0.25` — the conjunction avoids vacuuming a tiny database on ratio alone, or a multi-GB one where 100 MB is noise. `vacuum()` is also exposed unconditionally through the `compact_history_database` command for the manual "Compact database" button. `VACUUM` needs ~2× the database size on disk and holds an exclusive lock, so it never runs on the startup sweep or on the insert path. Both commands wrap the blocking work in `tokio::task::block_in_place` (lock is acquired with `.await` first — nesting `block_on` inside a runtime thread would panic). `storage_stats()` reports `page_count * page_size` and `freelist_count * page_size` — all three pragmas are database-header reads (O(1)), so the settings UI can refresh them on every `history-changed` event for free. Deliberately excludes an entry count: `SELECT COUNT(*)` is a full scan and `history-changed` fires on every prompt execution.

**Full-text search**: `conversations_fts` (FTS5 over `title`, `skill_name`, `input_content`, `output_content`) is kept in sync by the `conversations_fts_ai`/`_ad`/`_au` triggers; `search_fts` joins it to `conversations` on `rowid` and orders by `bm25` (weights 10, 5, 2, 1). The query string reaches `MATCH` as given, so callers (`history_search.rs`) must build a valid FTS5 expression. **Typo pass**: when the exact `run_fts` returns nothing, `history_search.rs` runs `run_fts` a second time with each token of ≥ 4 chars expanded to near vocabulary terms (the exact pass, its ranking and the `nucleo` fallback are unchanged; if the typo pass is empty too, `nucleo` runs as before). `Database::open` / `open_in_memory` create, per connection and after the migrations, three temp tables (no schema version): `temp.conversations_vocab` (`fts5vocab(main, conversations_fts, row)`, source of terms and their document count `doc`), and `temp.fold_fts` + `temp.fold_vocab` (an FTS5 table with the same `unicode61 remove_diacritics 2` tokenizer plus its vocab, used by `fold_token` to fold a query token like the index does; a token that folds to zero or several terms stays exact). A folded token is compared with the vocabulary terms by whole-term optimal-string-alignment Damerau-Levenshtein distance (insert, delete, substitute, adjacent transposition; lengths in chars): limit 1 for 4–6 chars, 2 from 7 chars. At most 5 terms per token are kept, nearest first, ties by higher `doc`, then term order; a token without candidate and tokens of 2–3 chars stay as their exact quoted term. An expanded token becomes `("a" OR "b")` and tokens are joined by spaces (AND). Highlights and the proximity bonus use all terms of all tokens, so they match the stored spelling in lowercase without diacritic folding (a title with diacritics found through a folded term is found but not highlighted). Each lookup scans the vocabulary rows of the length window, which is adequate up to tens of thousands of terms. Query text and terms are logged at no level; the pass logs counts at `debug`. `conn()` exposes the connection to commands that pass it to `AudioClipStore`, `SkillService::ensure_version` / `prune_missing_skills` and the settings-sync reload.

**Error enum**: `HistoryError` with variants `EntryNotFound(String)` and `Database(rusqlite::Error)`. `update_entry_result` and `delete_entry` return `EntryNotFound` for an unknown id.

### Hotkeys specifics

Mostly free functions translating keymap settings into `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`-compatible shortcut strings; the one state is `ShortcutActionMap` (shortcut → action, behind an `RwLock`), written by `reload_shortcuts` and read by the global-shortcut handler in `setup/shortcuts.rs`, which then calls `execute_hotkey_action`. `setup/shortcuts.rs` installs the plugin with that handler and an empty map, then calls `reload_shortcuts` to register the bindings.

**OS-aware translation**: `translate_shortcut(shortcut, os)` converts config format (`"cmd+f1"`) to plugin format (`"Command+F1"`). The `os` parameter (`"macos"` or anything else, in practice `"linux"`) affects only `cmd`: `Command` on macOS, `Super` otherwise.

**Rebinding**: the `add_shortcut` and `remove_shortcut` commands add or remove one shortcut of an action through `ConfigService::add_shortcut_for_os` / `remove_shortcut_for_os` (rules in "Settings writers" of the config part) and call `reload_shortcuts` right after the write, so the new binding is live without a restart.

**OS filtering**: `get_active_bindings(settings)` returns only bindings from `KeymapGroup` entries whose `context` matches the current OS (`std::env::consts::OS`). Returns `Vec<(translated_shortcut, action_name)>`.

**Validation**: shortcuts with fewer than 2 parts (no modifier) return `None` and are silently skipped.

**Key translation rules**: `cmd`→`Command`/`Super`, `ctrl`→`Control`, `shift`→`Shift`, `alt`→`Alt`, `meta`/`super`→`Super`. Key names: `f<N>` uppercased, single letters uppercased, named keys mapped (`space`→`Space`, `esc`→`Escape`, `up`→`ArrowUp`, etc.).

**Backends**: on GNOME Wayland (`gnome_shell::is_gnome_wayland()`) shortcuts are grabbed by the GNOME Shell extension; elsewhere by `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`. `to_gtk_accelerator` converts the `get_active_bindings` output (`Control+F1`, `ArrowUp`) to GTK accelerators (`<Control>F1`, `Up`) for the extension; an unknown key returns `None`. `setup/shortcuts.rs` selects the backend. See [linux-wayland-gnome-extension.md](../../../docs/gotchas/linux-wayland-gnome-extension.md).

### GnomeShell specifics

Linux-only D-Bus client for the `com.promptheus.Shell` interface served by the GNOME Shell extension (`linux/gnome-shell-extension/`). Uses `zbus`.

- `Shell` (`#[zbus::proxy]`, interface `com.promptheus.Shell`): `SetShortcuts`, `GetPointer`, `PlaceWindow`, `PlaceWindowAnchored`, `PlaceWindowOnParent`, `GetFocusedWmClass`, `ActivateWindow(title) → bool` (activates the `promptheus` window with that exact title, `false` after a 1000 ms wait), `ShowToast(level, title, message, monochromatic, action)`, `ShowRecordingWidget(x, y, has_position, monochromatic) → (x, y, work_x, work_y, work_width, work_height)` (placed origin and work area of the monitor it landed on), `UpdateRecordingWidget(state, level, elapsed_ms)`, `UpdateRecordingWidgetRetry(attempt, max_attempts, delay_ms)` (the `retrying` state; `UpdateRecordingWidget` rejects it), `HideRecordingWidget`, `CaptureArea(path) → outcome` (`captured` when the PNG is at `path`, `cancelled`; lasts as long as the user selects; the zbus connection sets no method timeout, so the call is not cut off), `CaptureSelection() → (outcome, text)` (`captured` with the selected text, `cancelled`; lasts until a selection arrives or the extension cancels it); signals `ShortcutActivated`, `ToastActivated(action)`, `Ready`, `RecordingWidgetAction` and `RecordingWidgetMoved(x, y, work_x, work_y, work_width, work_height)`.
- The session connection lives in a process-wide `OnceLock`, so callers without state (`frontmost_app::detect()`) reach it through `proxy()` (async) or `blocking_proxy()`.
- Recording pill additions: method `UpdateRecordingWidgetModel(a(ss), s, s, b, a(ussss), u, t, i, i, s)` (`update_recording_widget_model`: targets, selected id and label, target lock, items `(index, kind, label, preview, image_path)`, item rows, context version, x, y, stop + chat destination; no dropdown direction: the model carries none, see [speech/DOCS.md](speech/DOCS.md)) and signals `RecordingWidgetTargetSelected(s)` / `RecordingWidgetItemRemoved(u, t)` consumed in `setup/shortcuts.rs`; `RecordingWidgetAction` also carries `paste`, `stop_chat`, `screenshot` and `select_text`. A failed call is logged once per recording by `push_model`. See [speech/DOCS.md](speech/DOCS.md).
- `is_gnome_wayland()` is the backend selector: `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland` and `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` contains `GNOME`.
- `place_window(title, x, y, activate, show)` (context menu) and `place_window_anchored(title, right, bottom, activate, show)` (notification window) are the only callers of `PlaceWindow` and `PlaceWindowAnchored`; `place_window_on_parent(title, dx, dy, activate, show)` (provider menu, palette, backdrop) places a window relative to its transient parent, which `set_transient_parent(child, parent)` sets on the GTK main thread; all go through `call_placement`. With `show = Some(win)` the call is sent before `win.show()` and the reply awaited after it; with `None` it is a plain call to an already visible window.
- `frontmost_app` on Wayland reads `GetFocusedWmClass`; it returns an empty string when the extension is unreachable.
- Shortcuts run in `setup/shortcuts.rs` `run_shell_shortcuts`: `SetShortcuts` after every `Ready`; it falls back to the settings passed to `register` before `ConfigService` is managed.

### NotificationService specifics

Holds an `AppHandle`.

`notify(event, level, title, message, settings: &Settings)` takes the whole `Settings`: the event gate reads `settings.notifications.events`, the payload field `monochromatic` is `settings.appearance.icons == Skin::Mono`.

**Event gating**: `notify()` checks `settings.notifications.events` before showing. If the event is disabled in settings, the notification is silently dropped. Error-level notifications bypass the gate.

**`notify_now(app, event, level, title, message)`**: async; clones `Settings` from the managed `ConfigService` itself, then calls `notify`. Callers that have no settings at hand use it instead of locking the config and cloning `settings()`.

**Toast action**: `NotificationPayload.action` (`None` for most callers, `open_settings` for the missing-env toast; set through `notify_with_action`) makes a toast clickable: webview toasts invoke `open_settings_window`, GNOME toasts emit `ToastActivated`.

**Missing env refs** (`services/missing_env.rs`): the field walk lives in `visit_refs` (read, value with key and label) and `visit_refs_mut` (`&mut String`, same fields and order; used by the env variable rename of `settings_agent`), so every field that may hold `${VAR}` is listed once. `collect_missing` lists `${VAR}` names without a value (unset or empty in the process env) with the settings keys using them; only names and key paths, never values. `check_and_toast` runs once after startup (`setup::background::spawn_missing_env_check`) and in `apply_settings_reload` for reason `sync`; it toasts (`missing_env_refs`, warning, action `open_settings`) only when a name is new relative to `MissingEnvToastState`, the set at the last shown toast. Command `get_missing_env_refs` feeds the list at the top of the Settings window.

**Display**: `notify()` calls `services/notification_window.rs::show_notification`, which also owns the toast window queue, anchoring and resizing (`drain_pending_notifications`, `update_notification_window`; the commands of `commands/notification.rs` wrap them). On GNOME Wayland it routes to the extension's `ShowToast` (falling back to the notification webview window if the call fails); elsewhere it uses the notification webview window. See `docs/gotchas/linux-wayland-gnome-extension.md`.

**`is_event_enabled` mapping**: maps the string event names (9) (e.g., `"prompt_execution_success"`, `"context_set"`) to the corresponding bool field on `NotificationEvents`. Unknown event names return `true` (safe default — show rather than hide).

### MenuCoordinator specifics

Builds a flat, ordered list of `MenuItem`s from `MenuState` (skills, context items, recording and executing flags), which the commands in `commands/menu.rs` update directly through `MenuCoordinator.state`. Section order comes from `ConfigService.settings().menu_section_order`.

**Sections**: `"chat"`, `"skills"` (aliases `"prompts"`, `"SkillProvider"`), `"models"`, `"settings"`, `"speech"` (`"SpeechMenuProvider"`), `"lastInteraction"` (`"LastInteractionMenuProvider"`) and `"context"` (`"ContextMenuProvider"`) each have a `build_*_items` method; the long names are the ids `default_settings.json` still uses. Unknown ids produce no items. `models` and `settings` are built from `ConfigService`; the `lastInteraction` item carries no data here, `get_context_menu_items` fills it.

**Separator placement**: A `separator_after = true` flag is set on the last item of each non-final section. No trailing separator.

**Testing**: `full_menu_serializes_to_expected_json` asserts the whole serialized menu for a fixed `MenuState`; the other tests cover section order, separators, skipped empty sections, the skill `offered_in` filter and the speech and context items.

### AiService specifics

Multi-provider LLM service. Lives in `ai/` subdirectory with one file per provider. Uses `reqwest` for HTTP (not provider-specific SDKs) so a single dependency serves all providers.

**Provider trait** (`provider.rs`): `AiProvider` defines `complete(CompletionRequest) -> Result<String>` and `complete_stream(CompletionRequest) -> Result<Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = Result<StreamChunk>>>>>`. Providers are framework-independent — no Tauri imports.

**Provider registry**: `AiService::new(models)` iterates `ModelConfig` entries and matches on the `Provider` enum. Only `Provider::Openai` builds a client; `Anthropic`, `Gemini` and `ElevenLabs` models are recorded in `unavailable_models` with a reason ("provider not yet supported", "speech-to-text only"), as are OpenAI models whose provider fails to build (missing API key). The app still starts.

**API mode**: the model's `ApiMode` picks the provider, and each provider calls its own capability encoding function from `encoder.rs`: `Responses` → `OpenAiResponsesProvider` (`{base_url}/responses`, `encode_responses_capabilities`), `Completions` → `OpenAiProvider` (`{base_url}/chat/completions`, `encode_completions_capabilities`).

**Adding a new provider**:
1. Create `services/ai/<provider>.rs` implementing `AiProvider`.
2. Replace the `unavailable_models` arm of `AiService::new()` for that `Provider` variant (the variant already exists in `models/settings.rs`).

**Reasoning replay** (Responses): for a model with `ReasoningMode::Effort` the body carries `"include": ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` whether or not `reasoning_effort` is set (`encode_responses_capabilities`), other models never get `include`. A `response.output_item.done` of type `reasoning` becomes a `StreamChunk` with `reasoning_item`, the item JSON exactly as received; `to_responses_messages` emits a message's `ProcessedMessage.reasoning_items` in order right before its `function_call` items, so the next request of a tool loop carries them (`store: false` has no server-side copy). A `response.output_item.done` of type `web_search_call` is also kept as a raw item, in a chunk after its `ToolCallEvent::Done` chunk, in stream order with the reasoning items, so `to_responses_messages` replays reasoning and `web_search_call` items in their original order before the `function_call` items (OpenAI may reject a reasoning item replayed without the item that followed it); shared by the chat and the settings agent. `MockProvider` scripts it with `MockReply::WebSearchThen { id, queries, then }`: the `Started` and `Done` events, the raw `web_search_call` item, then the chunks of `then`. `reasoning_items` is `#[serde(skip)]`: history, IPC and the Completions body never carry it.

**Strict tools** (`tools.rs`): `mcp_tool_to_payload` adds `"strict": true` to the OpenAI Responses payload only for a tool whose `rmcp::model::Tool` has `_meta` key `promptheus/strict` (`STRICT_META_KEY`) set to `true`; the schema of such a tool must satisfy OpenAI strict rules (every object `additionalProperties: false`, every property required, optional ones nullable), otherwise the API rejects the request. Completions, Anthropic and tools without the key never get `strict`; MCP servers do not set it. Today the settings agent's `settings_read` and `settings_secret` carry it.

**Streaming architecture**: The `complete_stream` trait method returns an owned `Stream`. The execution commands (`commands/execution_stream.rs`, `commands/execution_control.rs`) bridge the streams the executors consume to a `tauri::ipc::Channel<StreamEvent>`. The per-service `AiService` lock is released (via clone of the cheap `Arc`-backed handle) before stream iteration to avoid holding it for the duration of the HTTP response.

**SSE parser** (`sse.rs`): Converts a `reqwest::Response` byte stream into parsed `data:` line payloads. Handles line buffering, comment skipping, and `[DONE]` termination. Provider-agnostic — usable by any SSE-based provider.

**Error variants**: `ModelNotFound`, `ModelUnavailable`, `Authentication`, `Connection`, `RateLimit`, `ApiStatus { status, message }`, `Stream`, `Request`.

**OpenAiProvider** (`openai.rs`) and **OpenAiResponsesProvider** (`openai_responses.rs`): Both build requests through `OpenAiHttp` (`http.rs`): API-key header, `base_url` (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via the `base_url` config field), connect error and HTTP status mapping to `AiError`. Streams follow one pattern: a `StreamState` with a pending-chunk queue and `process_chunk` / `process_event`, building `StreamChunk` through its constructors; unparseable tool-call arguments become `{}` in both. Model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) are merged into the request body when present; per-call overrides merge into a model's parameters through `ModelParameters::merged_with` (override wins per field, `extra` keys of the override win).

### PromptExecutionService specifics

Holds the state of the running skill execution and the live (streaming chat) execution; the message preparation lives in `skill_executor.rs` and `conversation_executor.rs`, the stream and tool loop in `stream.rs`. Lives in `execution/`.

**Shared request building**: `build_conversation_messages` (`conversation_executor.rs`) builds the system message and the tree messages of a send, reading `ConversationContextCache::pending_updates` (environment update if stale, then context update) into the last user node without writing the cache; `prepare` then calls `mark_context_sent`. `tools::build_tool_payloads` builds the built-in and MCP tool payloads. `AiService::complete_stream` and the command `count_conversation_tokens` both use these, so the count is the tokens of the messages text plus the serialized tool payloads plus the image tokens (`count_tokens` takes an `imageCount` for the OpenAI image constant, kept only in `commands/tokenizer.rs`). The skill wrapper `<skill name>…<input>` is built only by `skill_message::wrap_skill`.

**Tool loop messages**: `run_stream_loop` collects the `reasoning_item` of each chunk into `StreamResult.reasoning_items` without sending an event; `build_tool_loop_messages(pending, text, reasoning_items, results)` puts them on the assistant tool-call message (not on the tool messages). Both loops, `conversation_executor.rs` and `settings_agent/engine.rs`, pass `&result.reasoning_items`.

**Execution state**: one skill execution at a time. Starting while one runs returns `ExecutionError::AlreadyExecuting`; starting creates an execution id (UUID) and a `watch` cancel channel; finishing clears both and the live execution. `is_busy()` reports it, `cancel_execution()` signals the cancel channel. The live execution (`LiveExecution`, `start_live`, `cancel_live`, `clear_live`) has its own cancel channel and an `ExecutionSnapshot` of the streamed text. Every event the stream emits goes through `LiveExecution` methods that update the snapshot and send on the channel (`send` drops a closed channel, `finish_with_error`, `finish_done`, `finish_tool_call`); `stream.rs` and `conversation_executor.rs` call them and never touch `channel` directly.

**Model resolution** (associated functions, take `&ConfigService`, one-line wrappers over the private `resolve(config, explicit, surface)` in `lifecycle.rs`): an explicit model id must exist in `models`, else `ModelNotFound`; without one, `resolve_model` falls back to `surfaces.chat.generation.model_id`, `resolve_quick_action_model` to `surfaces.quick_actions.generation.model_id` then the chat model, `resolve_title_generation_model` to `surfaces.title_generation.generation.model_id` then the chat model.

**Error enum**: `ExecutionError` with variants `AlreadyExecuting` and `ModelNotFound(String)`.

### Adding a new service

1. Create `services/<name>.rs` with error enum + struct + impl.
2. Add `pub mod <name>;` to `services/mod.rs`.
3. Wire into Tauri managed state in `setup/state.rs`.
4. Add tests using `tempfile` for any file I/O.

## Secrets

`secrets.rs` handles values referenced as `${VAR}` in settings (`env_resolve.rs`). A secret value never reaches the settings agent.

- **Override map**: `env_resolve` keeps a process-wide `RwLock<HashMap<String, Option<String>>>` (`Some` = set, `None` = removed). `env_value(name)` reads it before `std::env::var`; `resolve_env_refs` and `env_is_set` (`missing_env.rs`) read through it. A save sets the override; there is no `std::env::set_var` after startup because it is undefined behaviour on glibc while other threads read the environment. `.env` is loaded into the process environment once at startup (`config/loader.rs`) and the override shadows that copy.
- **`.env` format**: `save_secret` replaces the line of the variable (`NAME=…` or `export NAME=…`) or appends `NAME="<value>"`; `\`, `"`, `$` and newlines are escaped (`\\`, `\"`, `\$`, `\n`) so `dotenvy` reads the value back exactly. Other lines stay as they are; a new file gets mode `0o600`. `current_value(config_dir, name)`: override, else `<config>/.env`, else `std::env`.
- **Backups**: before each write the previous value goes to `<config>/secret-backups/<entry id>.env` as `NAME="<previous>"` (dir `0o700`, file `0o600`, never synced). Order: backup, `.env`, override, change-log entry (`kind: secret`, `SecretChange { name, backup, had_previous }`, no value). Entry details: [change_log/DOCS.md](change_log/DOCS.md).
- **Undo**: `undo_secret` restores the backed-up value or, for a first-time secret, removes the variable; both write a `kind: undo` entry with its own backup. A backup missing on this host (the entry came from another host) returns `UndoOutcome::Skipped { held_by }` and changes nothing.
- **Renamed values**: `copy_renamed_values(config_dir, settings)` gives each listed `env_vars` name that has no non-empty value (`current_value`) the value of the first `renamed_from` name, in list order, that has one: it writes `NAME="<value>"` to `.env` and sets the override. It runs at startup in `setup/init.rs` after `ConfigService::load` and before `setup::state::manage` (so `AiService` and `McpRegistry` resolve the copied values), and at the top of `apply_settings_reload` under the config guard, before `rebuild_ai`, so sync reloads, `reload_if_changed` and agent apply/undo all copy. One process-wide mutex serializes it with `apply_secret` (`save_secret`, `undo_secret`) on `.env`. The old key stays in `.env` (stale, never removed); the copy writes no change-log entry and no backup; a write failure logs `warn` and the loop continues. Logs carry names only.
- **Redactor**: `Redactor::new(config_dir, settings)` collects every non-empty value in `<config>/.env`, every override value, the resolved value of every `${VAR}` in the settings (names from `missing_env::collect_missing`), every literal model `api_key`, every value in the secret backups (`secret-backups/`) and every literal (no `${VAR}`) value of `mcp_servers.*.env`; the last three have no variable name. `with_values` adds staged card values (also nameless). A value is exempt only when every source of it is a variable listed in `env_vars` with `secret: false`. `redact` replaces each occurrence, longest value first, with `[redacted]`. `redact_settings` additionally replaces literal `api_key` fields and literal `mcp_servers.*.env` values; `${VAR}` references stay readable.
- **Commands**: `save_secret(name, value)` and `get_secret_value(name)` in `commands/settings_dialog.rs` serve the settings GUI only; no agent tool calls them.
